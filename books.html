<p>What is the brief history of India? The history of India starts with the existence of India itself as It located in the continent of Asia, India covers 2,973,193 square kilometers of land and 314,070 square kilometers of water. 

 

Making it the 7th largest nation in the world with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometers. Surrounded by Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to the North East, China to the North, Pakistan to the North West, and Sri Lanka on the South East coast. 

 

India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic, and cultural configurations are the products of a long process of regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism arose in the Vedic period.

 

The fifth-century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in his reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to India for the first time and by the eleventh century had firmly established itself in India as a political force. It resulted in the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity.


It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English emerged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed; and with the subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation of India into the empire was complete. It was followed by India's struggle for independence, which we got in the year 1947. Here is a brief timeline about the history of India:

<p>

Many kingdoms and dynasties competed for power in medieval India. While some Buddhist kingdoms existed, most kings followed the religion of Hinduism, weakening the power of Buddhism. While these kings sponsored art, architecture, and religion, they also waged bloody warfare. For centuries these Hindu kingdoms waged war and attempted to secure control of the whole continent, but were unable to. Meanwhile, the Chola Dynasty in the far south would expand out of India by boat, conquering distant islands. This balance of power changed with the invasion of Muslims from the northwest, who swept across India. The first of the large Muslim polities in India was the Delhi Sultanate, which would last centuries. The Muslims in the north were challenged by the Hindu kingdoms to the south, the largest of whom would soon be the Vijayanagara Dynasty. The Delhi Sultanate would be defeated in 1526 by the Mughal Empire, which came to control all of India and marked the beginning of the modern era of Indian history.

The following is a timeline of the rise and fall of the powerful kingdoms of medieval India:

500: the northwest of the Gupta Empire is conquered by the Huns; the empire falls into decline
730: the Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty conquered most of northern India
800: the Rashtrakuta Dynasty rises to power in the south, while the Pala Empire becomes the largest power in the north
1010: the Chola Dynasty stretches beyond southern India across the sea
1050: Lakshmikarna of Tripuri rules most of northern India
1206: the Delhi Sultanate begins, conquering most of northern India and eventually parts of the south as well
1336: the Vijayanagara Empire rules over the south, resisting the Muslim conquest
1526: the Mughal Empire toppled Delhi, soon conquering most of India

The Indian Independence Movement (1885-1947)
The Indian independence movement was one of the most significant political movements in the modern history of India. The rise of Indian nationalism was due to several factors. Some historians say it was because the British rule was exploitative. Some say that it was because the British were unfair and racially discriminatory towards Indians. Still, others argue that it was a combination of these and more factors.

The Indian independence movement went through several stages. The first significant change brought about by the movement was the formation of an advisory council for the Viceroy of India. The other achievement was the appointment of Indians to this council in 1861. These were efforts in the direction of self-rule.

But later events brought about a demand for complete independence. The call for Swaraj was given by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The Swadeshi movement also came up as a part of the umbrella movement of the Indian Independence movement. This was propagated by Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The partition of Bengal was another impetus in the movement for complete independence. It was a major cause of a feeling of disenfranchisement among Indians.

After the First World War: The British government adopted a “carrot and stick” approach after the First World War. This was done as a recourse against the rising nationalist movement and as compensation for the Indian troops in World War-I. After 1920, the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi used peaceful methods of protest that saw the participation of people from all over the country.
After the Second World War: The year 1946 saw great upheaval in the country’s political milieu. Several mutinies happened in the different armed forces. Along with these mutinies, the Indian National Congress won 8 out of 11 provinces in elections. Late in 1946, the Labour government that was in power in Britain decided that it would end British rule in India. They stated that the transfer of power would be completed by June 1948.
Independence and Partition
India was split into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. It is one of the most tragic events in recent history. Millions of people were displaced, and hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the riots that accompanied the partition. The trauma of the events has had long-lasting effects on the socio-political setup of both countries.

Conclusion
The history of modern India is a testament to the making of a nation. It tells the story of how people came together and achieved a goal that was seemingly impossible. History is important because it is a record of human effort and progress.

 <h2 style="color:blue;"> OUR INDIAN LITERACY SOURCES</h2>
<br><br>
<p>

The ancient Indian literature is mostly religious in nature.

The Puranic and Epic literature are considered as history by Indians, but it contains no definite dates for events and kingdoms.

The effort of history writing was shown by a large number of inscriptions, coins, and local chronicles. The principles of history are preserved in the Puranas and Epics.

The Puranas and epics narrate the genealogies of kings and their achievements. But they are not arranged in a chronological order.

The Vedic literature contains mainly the four Vedas i.e. Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvanaveda.

The Vedic literature is in a different language called as the Vedic language. Its vocabulary contains a wide range of meaning and is different in grammatical usages. It has a definite mode of pronunciation in which emphasis changes the meaning entirely.

The Vedas give reliable information about the culture and civilization of the Vedic period, but do not reveal the political history.

Six Vedangas are the important limbs of Vedas. They were evolved for the proper understanding of the Vedas. The Vedangas are −

Siksha (Phonetics)

Kalpa (Rituals)

Vyakarna (Grammar)

Nirukta (Etymology)

Chhanda (Metrics) and

Jyotisha (Astronomy).

As per the 2014 FAO world agriculture statistics India is the world's largest producer of many fresh fruits like banana, mango, guava, papaya, lemon and vegetables like chickpea, okra and milk, major spices like chili pepper, ginger, fibrous crops such as jute, staples such as millets and castor oil seed. India is the second largest producer of wheat and rice, the world's major food staples.[14]

India is currently the world's second largest producer of several dry fruits, agriculture-based textile raw materials, roots and tuber crops, pulses, farmed fish, eggs, coconut, sugarcane and numerous vegetables. India is ranked under the world's five largest producers of over 80% of agricultural produce items, including many cash crops such as coffee and cotton, in 2010.[14] India is one of the world's five largest producers of livestock and poultry meat, with one of the fastest growth rates, as of 2011.[15]

One report from 2008 claimed that India's population is growing faster than its ability to produce rice and wheat.[16] While other recent studies claim that India can easily feed its growing population, plus produce wheat and rice for global exports, if it can reduce food staple spoilage/wastage, improve its infrastructure and raise its farm productivity like those achieved by other developing countries such as Brazil and China.[17][18]
